# Disrupting the Bathroom Industry at Memorial University of Newfoundland

## 🚀 Project Overview

The **Bathroom Disruption Project (BDP)** aims to revolutionize the bathroom experience at Memorial University of Newfoundland (MUN). This project seeks to identify inefficiencies, improve accessibility, and introduce innovative solutions to enhance the overall bathroom experience on campus. Our goal is to address issues such as cleanliness, accessibility, wait times, and sustainability, while providing students and staff with a more efficient and enjoyable environment.

By leveraging technology, user feedback, and creative design solutions, we hope to create a smarter, more sustainable, and user-centered bathroom experience.

## 📋 Objectives

- **Improve Efficiency**: Optimize bathroom layouts and usage patterns to reduce wait times and increase overall efficiency.
- **Enhance Cleanliness**: Implement smarter cleaning systems, real-time tracking of usage, and sanitation alerts to maintain cleanliness at all times.
- **Promote Accessibility**: Ensure bathrooms are fully accessible to all students, including those with disabilities, with inclusive designs and features.
- **Sustainability**: Introduce eco-friendly solutions like water-saving fixtures, sustainable materials, and waste reduction strategies.
- **Data-Driven Insights**: Use IoT and sensor technology to collect data on bathroom usage patterns, helping us make informed decisions about maintenance, resource allocation, and design improvements.
